<h2>Create <code>gangsta</code> objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>compoundFactory</code> and <code>processFactory</code> are the primary functions
used to create gangsta objects.  <code>compoundFactory</code> is a function that
creates a <code>compound</code> object and all associated <code>pool</code> objects for
use by the <code>gangsta</code> package. <code>processFactory</code> creates a
<code>process</code> object and all associated <code>transfer</code> objects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
compoundFactory(compoundName, molarRatios, initialMolecules,
  respirationRate = NA, infiniteCompound = F)

processFactory(gangstaObjects, processName, energyTerm, fromCompoundNames,
  toCompoundNames, molarTerms, transferOptions = NULL, organismName = "",
  limitToInitMolecules = T)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>compoundName</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of <code>length = 1</code> containing the
name of the
<code>compound</code> to be created.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>molarRatios</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named numeric vector.  Vector names are the names of the
chemical elements (think 'periodic table in chemistry') that are in the
<code>compound</code> and that are to be tracked by <code>gangsta</code>.  Values in
the vector are the ratios for the number of atoms of each element in the
<code>compound</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>initialMolecules</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of mols (or umols, etc.) of the compound
available at the beginning of the simulation.  If the <code>compound</code> is of
type <code>infiniteCompound</code>, then <code>initialMolecules</code> must be set to 0.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>respirationRate</code></td>
<td>
<p>The respiration rate (in units of energy per unit of
biomass per model timestep); applies to <code>organism</code> objects.  When
<code>respirationRate</code> is numeric, an <code>organism</code> object is returned.
When NA, a <code>compound</code> object is returned.  <code>respirationRate</code>
values must be negative (i.e., energy cost to the organisms).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>infiniteCompound</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean when set to <code>TRUE</code> tags a
<code>compound</code> as being unlimited in supply. <code>infiniteCompound</code>s
represent sources/sinks.  When <code>infiniteCompound</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>,
<code>initialMolecules</code> must be set to 0.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>gangstaObjects</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of objects of class <code>gangsta</code> representing
the <code>organisms</code>, <code>compounds</code>, <code>pools</code>, <code>processes</code>, and
<code>transfers</code> to be included in the model.  These objects are created
using <code>compoundFactory</code> and <code>processFactory</code>.
<code>compoundFactory</code> must be executed before <code>processFactory</code>
because <code>gangstaObjects</code> for all <code>compounds</code> involved in a
<code>process</code> must be created before <code>processFactory</code> can create the
<code>process</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>processName</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of the name of the <code>process</code> to be
created.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>energyTerm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The chemical affinity of the processs.  A positive number
represents a process that yeilds energy, a negative number represents a
process that consumes energy.  Units are kJ (or J, etc.) of energy per mol
(or umol, etc.) of the reaction.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fromCompoundNames</code></td>
<td>
<p>Named <code>list</code> where the name of each <code>list</code>
member is the a chemical element derived from the compound.  For instance,
to track carbon flux from the oxidation of glucose, the
<code>fromCompoundNames</code> list might be <code>list(C = "C6H12O6", O = "O2")</code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>toCompoundNames</code></td>
<td>
<p>See <code>fromCompoundNames</code>.  To track carbon flux
from the oxidation of glucose, the <code>toCompoundNames</code> list might be
<code>list(C = "CO2", O = "Ox")</code> (where Ox is a undifferentiated sink for
oxygen comprised of H2O and CO2).  The names of <code>toCompoundNames</code> must
be the same and in the same order as those of <code>fromCompoundNames</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>molarTerms</code></td>
<td>
<p>Named list containing the mols (or umols, etc.) of each
element that are transfered by the <code>process</code>.  The names of
<code>molarTerms</code> must be the same and in the same order as those of
<code>fromCompoundNames</code> and <code>toCompoundNames</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>transferOptions</code></td>
<td>
<p>When transferOptions is <code>NULL</code>,
<code>processFactory</code> will create these automatically.
<code>transferOptions</code> consist of a list of integer or numeric vectors
containing the indicies of transfers in a process.  This specification is
appropriate when each <code>from pool</code> has exactly one <code>to
pool</code>.  However, these must be specified when more than one <code>to pool</code>
exists for any transfer involved in a process, i.e., indicies are grouped
when transfers represent optional pathways. For instance, if a process has
four transfers (fromA -&gt; toA, fromB -&gt; toB1, fromB -&gt; toB2, fromC -&gt; toC),
the second and third transfers can represent an option.  fromB can go to
either toB1 or toB2, so long as the sum of the two options is in
stoichiometric balance with the A and C tranfers.  To represent such an
option, the transferOption list would be <code>list(1, 2:3, 4)</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>organismName</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the organism carrying out the <code>process</code>.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>gangsta</code> uses several classes of S3 objects to represent
biogeochemical systems.  All S3 objects in <code>gangsta</code> are built atop
named lists with the class arribute set.  The list's names are used as
attribute names and the values in the lists are the attribute values.
</p>
<p><code>compound</code> objects represent chemical species (e.g., SO4 and HS) that
generally contain one or more chemical elements; the mols (or umols, etc.) of
each element of interest (i.e., tracked element) within a <code>compound</code> are
tracked using a <code>pool</code>.  Each <code>pool</code> records the mols of a tracked
element in the <code>compound</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>molarRatios</code> describe the chemical composition of the
tracked elements contained in compounds. For example, the <code>molarRatios</code>
for water could be represented as <code>c(H = 2, O = 1)</code> because a molecule
of water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
</p>
<p>Not all elements in a <code>compound</code> must be tracked.  The model developer
only creates <code>pool</code>s for the elements of interest.  For instance, when
creating a <code>compound</code> for SO4, passing <code>c(S=1)</code> to
<code>compoundFactory</code> as the <code>molarRatios</code> vector would create only a
<code>pool</code> for sulfur, not for oxygen.  Two <code>pool</code>s, one for sulfur and
one for oxygen, would be created by passing <code>c(S=1, O=4)</code>.
</p>
<p><code>compound</code> objects have attributes named <code>name</code>,
<code>initialMolecules</code> which are the starting values for the model run, and
<code>infiniteCompound</code> which is a Boolean indicating whether the compound is
a source/sink.
</p>
<p><code>compound</code> objects are also used to represent organisms (which
assimilate elements as they grow) in <code>gangsta</code>-derived models.
<code>organism</code> objects inherit from <code>compound</code> and contain an extra
attribute called <code>respirationRate</code> For <code>organism</code>s, the
<code>respirationRate</code> is energy (J, KJ, etc.) per mol (or umol, etc.) of
<code>compound</code> per timestep.
</p>
<p><code>pool</code> objects have attributes called <code>name</code>, <code>elementName</code> which is
the chemical element stored in the <code>pool</code>, <code>compoundName</code> which
indicates the compound with which the pool is associated, and
<code>molarRatio</code> which describes the ratio of atoms in the <code>pool</code> per
unit molecule, i.e., <code>compound</code>.
</p>
<p><code>process</code> objects have attributes called <code>name</code>, <code>energyTerm</code> which
is equal to the energy generated or consumed by the <code>process</code>,
<code>organismName</code> which is the name of the <code>organism</code> carrying out the
<code>process</code>, and <code>transferOptions</code> which are indices for the
<code>transfer</code>s associated with each <code>process</code>.  Each <code>process</code> with
nonzero <code>energyTerm</code> is of class &quot;metabolic.&quot;
</p>
<p><code>transfer</code> objects have attributes called <code>name</code>, <code>from</code> which is the
<code>pool</code> from which atoms are being transfered, <code>to</code> which is the
<code>pool</code> to which atoms are being transfered, <code>molarTerm</code> which
enforces the stoichiometry of the <code>process</code>, <code>molarAffinity</code> which
is equal to the <code>energyTerm</code> of the <code>process</code> divided by the
<code>molarTerm</code> of the <code>transfer</code>, <code>processName</code> which is the name
of the <code>process</code> that the <code>transfer</code> is associated with, and
<code>limitToInitMolecules</code> which is a Boolean that inherits from <code>process</code>.
</p>
<p><code>gangsta</code>-derived models can operate using any unit of atomic count unit
(mols, umols, etc.), unit of energy (Joules, KJ, etc.) over any time unit
defined by the user.  However, it is critical that all units for values
passed to the model be consistent.  For example, the units of
<code>respirationRate</code> and the units of atomic count used by <code>pool</code>
objects must be consistent with the units of all other values passed to
functions in the <code>gangsta</code> package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>compoundFactory</code> returns a list of <code>compound</code> and <code>pool</code>
objects. <code>processFactory</code> return a list of <code>process</code> and
<code>transfer</code> objects.
